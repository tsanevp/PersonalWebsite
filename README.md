# NOTICE
This is my old personal portfolio. To view my new and updated site, please visit https://www.petertsanev.com - Cheers!

# Personal Website
This website was built before I learned Bootstrap, JS, and other packages/libraries that could have improved the quality/readability of my code. I'm choosing to keep the code as is so that once I build out an improved version of my website, I can reference where I started.

## Overview

### The challenge

- Creating a personal website from scratch with no prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JS:
    - Since I had no experience with design or web development, it was difficult to create a website that was appealing to the eye and easy to navigate. It took a lot of feedback for me to recognize what works and does not.
- Finding a color scheme that suited my site's content:
    - I wanted to use colors that look good on any monitor and screen.
- Keeping my code readable and easy to understand:
    - With zero previous experience, I was learning best coding practices on the go.

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML5
- Vanilla CSS
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

- It is best to take a mobile-first approach when designing and building a website. It makes it easier to create a responsive site.
- Creating a website using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS is a pain but a good learning experience.

### Continued development

- [ ]  Make the website responsive
- [ ]  Add more JS to improve the page design
- [ ]  Add more technical projects
- [ ]  Add personal non-technical projects/work experience

### Useful resources

- [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Always a good place to refer to for any HTML, CSS, JS questions
- Friends who do not code. They provide quality feedback from a different perspective
