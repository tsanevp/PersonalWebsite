## Overview

### The challenge

- Intuitive navigation and transition between pages:
    - Since this page doesn’t have the conventional layout, it can be hard to navigate for some people. It takes a lot of feedback for me to recognize what works and does not work for someone who’s visiting for the first time.
- Keeping files short and sweet — reusable and maintainable
    - I just don’t want to look at my code and moan
    - But who can guarantee that will never happen
    - I just try to avoid that as much as possible
